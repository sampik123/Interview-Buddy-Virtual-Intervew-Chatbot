# Interview-Buddy-Virtual-Intervew-Chatbot
Created a Streamlit chatbot application that conducts user interviews. The chatbot will prompt users to introduce themselves and specify the job role they are seeking an interview for (e.g., Data Science, HR manager, Developer, Project Manager, etc.). Based on the specified job role, the chatbot will ask role-specific questions. After the interview questions, the chatbot will conclude the interview by providing a brief feedback on the user's performance. Additionally, the application included an "exit interview" and "New Interview" button to exit from interview conversation and allowing the user to start a new interview.

Tools and technology : Langchain, Streamlit,
